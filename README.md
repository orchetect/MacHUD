# HUDKit

A macOS HUD (heads-up-display) library written in Swift.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement customizable behavior in notification manager to only show most recent notification, or to bump the last 'x' number of notificaitons on the screen so they are all visible.
  - [ ] Started implementing already - there is a variable settable with an enum that defines the behavior. Just need to code the actual behavior now.
